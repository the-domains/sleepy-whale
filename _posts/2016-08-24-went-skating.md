# Went Skating

I can't actually believe that I dropped in on the half pipe with my _pathetically_ tiny skateboard last night.

I was joking around about doing it with my friend as I was TOTALLY UNPREPARED and suddenly these two twelve-year olds rolled up on their scooters with their caps turned backwards and told me _"the hospital is nearby, it's not like there's anything stopping you". _I thought "_thank you Canada for making Healthcare so available that this becomes the standard logical reasoning for the youth of today". _I smiled and dropped in against all of my fear. Nailed it perfectly, and thanked the tiny ones for the support.
